            Let your website or mobile app work across multiple platforms like
            Windows, Android. Originally, the complexity of developing apps was
            compounded by the difficulty of building out a backend that worked
            with multiple operating systems. We use top cross-platform
            development tools including Xamarin, React Native & Apache Cordova.
